I came across these words scrawled across a wall deep below the city of Berlin.

They belong to the poem Kubla Khan, considered to be one of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's three greats along with _The Rime of the Ancient Mariner_ and _Christabel_. It was composed one night after an opium fueled dream, but left uncompleted after Coleridge was interrupted by a [person from Porlock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_from_Porlock). It describes Xanadu, the summer palace of the Mongol ruler and Emperor of China Kublai Khan. The [full poem is on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubla_Khan#Poem).
