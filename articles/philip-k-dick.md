  Recognize the title _We Can Remember It for You Wholesale_? Maybe not, but it's closely related to the remake of a classic blockbuster recalled through time for the witty quips of its lead Austrian actor, and of course, its inclusion of a three-breasted woman.

With the upcoming remake of _Total Recall_ (aka _We Can Remember It for You Wholesale_), it's worth taking a moment to remember the man who composed the source material. Here are a few passages from _Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said_ to help glimpse the literary genius of Philip K. Dick.

> "Drive me back to the academy," Buckman said. "I don't think I can drive; I'm shaking too bad." He felt something on his face; putting up his hand, he found that his chin was wet, "What's this on me?" he said, amazed.
>
> "You're crying," Herb said.

And:

> I must turn a terrible tragedy into an advantage, Buckman realized. Capitalize on the accidental death of my own sister. If it _was_ accidental.
>
> "Maybe it's true," he said. Possibly Marshal Holbein, for example, who hated him enormously, had arranged it.
>
> "No," Herb said. "It's not true. But start an inquiry. And you must find someone to pin it on; there must be a trial."

If you're looking for a book to read, consider passing on _The Hunger Games_ and try _The Man in the High Castle_, or _Now Wait for Last Year_ (my personal favorite) instead.
